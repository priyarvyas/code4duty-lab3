# Code4Duty - TodoApp
As a part of our course, this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

`dist/` folder is already included for users to see the code in action.
 just do 
 `npm i -g http-server` to install http-server.
 Go to `dist/` folder and run `http-server ./todo-app` command.
 Navigate to the url shown in the cmd.
 
 ## Thank you
